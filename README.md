# goobjectscale

> üöß **NOTE:** The *goobjectscale* is in a preview stage, and API is subject to change between minor updates. Until `v1.0.0` we do not guarantee backwards compatibility between versions.

## Overview

_goobjectscale_ is a Go package that provides a client for the Dell ObjectScale Managment HTTP API and helpers for Dell ObjectScale Identity and Access Management (IAM) HTTP API (compatible with Amazon Web Servicess IAM).

## Examples

The tests provide working examples for how to use the package, but here are a few code snippets to further illustrate the basic ideas.

### Initialize a new client


```go
// TODO: write an example for initializing the client
```

### Create new bucket

```go
// TODO: write an example for creating bucket
```

### Delete the bucket

```go
// TODO: write an example for deleting bucket
```

### Initialize IAM client

```go
// TODO: write example usage of IAM helpers
```

## Contributions

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something.

We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.
