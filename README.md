# goobjectscale

> üöß **NOTE:** The *goobjectscale* is in a preview stage, and API is subject to change between minor updates. Until `v1.0.0` we do not guarantee backwards compatibility between versions.

## Overview

_goobjectscale_ is a Go package that provides a client for the Dell ObjectScale Managment HTTP API and helpers for Dell ObjectScale Identity and Access Management (IAM) HTTP API (compatible with Amazon Web Servicess IAM).

## Examples

The tests provide working examples for how to use the package, but here are a few code snippets to further illustrate the basic ideas.

### Initialize a new client


```go
import (
	"github.com/dell/goobjectscale/pkg/client/rest"
	"github.com/dell/goobjectscale/pkg/client/rest/client"
)

// First, provide user credentials for your ObjectScale.
objectscaleAuthUser := objectscaleClient.AuthUser{
	Gateway:  "https://gateway.example.com:443",
	Username: "example-user",
	Password: "example-password",
}

// Next create valid HTTP transport, including TLS config.
transport := &http.Transport{
	TLSClientConfig: &tls.Config{
		InsecureSkipVerify: true // Insecure only for demo purpose.
	},
}

// Finally, create REST clientset
clientset := rest.NewClientSet(&objectscaleClient.Simple{
	Endpoint:       "https://objectstore.example.com:4443",
	Authenticator:  &user,
	HTTPClient:     &http.Client{Transport: transport},
	OverrideHeader: false,
})
```

### Get existing bucket

```go
// Create new parameters map, that will be provided to the Get call.
parameters := map[string]string{
	"namespace": "osaia3382ab190a7a3df", // "namespace" is a required parameter
}

// NOTE: Create clientset beforehand.

// Get existing bucket.
bucket, err := clientset.Buckets().Get("example-bucket", parameters)
```

### Create new bucket

```go
import "github.com/dell/goobjectscale/pkg/client/model"

// NOTE: Create clientset beforehand.

// Create new bucket using clientset.
bucket, err = clientset.Buckets().Create(&model.Bucket{
	Name: "example-bucket",             // Name is a required field
	Namespace: "osaia3382ab190a7a3df",  // Namespace is a required field
})
```

### Delete the bucket

```go
import "github.com/dell/goobjectscale/pkg/client/model"

// NOTE: Create clientset beforehand.

// Delete bucket requires bucket name, namespace and emptyBucket parameters.
// EmptyBucket indicates if the bucket should be deleted, if it has any objects.
err := clientset.Buckets().Delete("example-bucket", "osaia3382ab190a7a3df", false)
```

### Initialize IAM client

```go
import (
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/iam"
	"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/session"
)

// Let's use default HTTP Client.
x509Client := *http.DefaultClient

// First, provide user credentials for your ObjectScale.
objectscaleAuthUser := &objectscaleClient.AuthUser{
	Gateway:  "https://gateway.example.com:443",
	Username: "example-user",
	Password: "example-password",
}

// Create new session with custom endpoint.
iamSession, err := session.NewSession(&aws.Config{
	Endpoint:                      "https://gateway.example.com:443",
	Region:                        "us-west-1",
	CredentialsChainVerboseErrors: aws.Bool(true),
	HTTPClient: x509Client,
})

// Create new IAM client using the session above.
iamClient = iam.New(iamSession)

// Before using IAM client, we need to do some additional setup.
// First we need to inject ObjectScale access token from objectscaleAuthUser structure.
InjectTokenToIAMClient(iamClient, objectscaleAuthUser, x509Client)

// Next we need to inject Account ID / Namespace (those).
InjectAccountIDToIAMClient(iamClient, "osaia3382ab190a7a3df")

// Finally we can use the IAM client to do API calls to ObjectScale.
user, err := iamClient.CreateUser(&iam.CreateUserInput{
	UserName: userName,
})
```

## Contributions

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyway. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something.

We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

## FAQ

### What is the Namespace? What is the AccountID?

Those two terms used around codebase are unfortunatly referring to the same thing. The easiest way to obtain it is to look in Objectscale Portal.
